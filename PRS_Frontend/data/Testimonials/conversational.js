    review: `Sybill isn't just tech for Sales Enablement.
Every function within an organization can gain so much from recording team meetings and later analyzing parts of them.
This leads to better understanding specific conversations during meetings and picking up on non-verbal cues from attendees that you may have missed.`,

    review: `I started sharing my Sybill recordings with clients, which is great for them to go back to the demo and share our solution with their colleagues. I also started sharing it with our customer success and onboarding team too, which is valuable in understanding the client’s requirements and what was discussed during the sales process. It will continue to bridge gaps and help with our handoff  and account management practice.`,

    review: `One of the big gaps (in my opinion) in most coaching is the flawed feedback process. As a sales coach, people will tell me things like “and then I said “you should buy this because…” and I ask them if thats HOW they said it or “how did they respond”. They always say “thats not how I said it to them…”. How you say things absolutely matters in sales and not being able to go and “watch tape” for clients removes the ability for them to see their mistakes vs getting defensive. Sybill is the best tool I have played with so far.`,
