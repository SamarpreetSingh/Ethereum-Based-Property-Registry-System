    review:
      'Helping advise Angel, Seed, and Series A startups on finding product-market fit requires the use of a tool like Sybill.  Meaning, Sybill helps me determine engagement on calls by slide, to see if changes with the positioning and messaging work or not.  Sybill gives you all the nonverbal communication insights that you would normally get in face-to-face meetings, but via Zoom.',

    review: `This has been my secret weapon for the last few months.
So many strong use cases - but getting a body language analysis on top of conversational intelligence is a game changer (I donâ€™t use that term loosely)
Getting a report of how engaged they were or if they disengaged when I answered certain questions etc. 
Majority of communication is non verbal, so this just makes sense to me`,

    review: `Sybill isn't just tech for Sales Enablement.
Every function within an organization can gain so much from recording team meetings and later analyzing parts of them.
This leads to better understanding specific conversations during meetings and picking up on non-verbal cues from attendees that you may have missed.`,
