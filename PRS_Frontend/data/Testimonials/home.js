    review: `Sybill helps me determine engagement on calls by slide, to see if changes with the positioning and messaging work or not.  Sybill gives you all the nonverbal communication insights that you would normally get in face-to-face meetings, but via Zoom.`,

    review: `I love going back into Sybill after calls to look at where the prospective clients that I'm talking to are disengaged - was it something I said, was it part of the talk track? Was it, some consistent aspect of our presentation that multiple prospects have been disengaging with? I've been trying to go back in and see if I can find those kinds of things out.`,

    review: `This has been my secret weapon for the last few months.
So many strong use cases - but getting a body language analysis on top of conversational intelligence is a game changer (I don’t use that term loosely)
Getting a report of how engaged they were or if they disengaged when I answered certain questions etc. 
Majority of communication is non verbal, so this just makes sense to me.`,

    review: `I started sharing my Sybill recordings with clients, which is great for them to go back to the demo and share our solution with their colleagues. I also started sharing it with our customer success and onboarding team too, which is valuable in understanding the client’s requirements and what was discussed during the sales process. It will continue to bridge gaps and help with our handoff  and account management practice.`,

    review: `One of the big gaps (in my opinion) in most coaching is the flawed feedback process. As a sales coach, people will tell me things like “and then I said “you should buy this because…” and I ask them if thats HOW they said it or “how did they respond”. They always say “thats not how I said it to them…”. How you say things absolutely matters in sales and not being able to go and “watch tape” for clients removes the ability for them to see their mistakes vs getting defensive. Sybill is the best tool I have played with so far.`,
