    review: `I love going back into Sybill after calls to look at where the prospective clients that I'm talking to are disengaged - was it something I said, was it part of the talk track? Was it, some consistent aspect of our presentation that multiple prospects have been disengaging with? I've been trying to go back in and see if I can find those kinds of things out.`,

    review: `I have used a few different video recording platforms and have landed on Sybill as the one I want in my tech stack. It gives me the ability to jump to parts in the conversation (with ease) where I see different reactions in my prospects and customers. This leads to me not only coaching myself, but giving leadership the ability to quickly and efficiently provide feedback as well. I also find that during deal review, I don't have to say what the customer said back to my team - I can provide a snippet and let them hear it for themselves which is so much more impactful.`,

    review: `I want, I want everybody to have this thing. Iâ€™m so, so fanatical about it. [...] But dude, this is so nice. My friend it's so it's so, so, so good. 
And like it works and there's so much little like nuance to like, you can look at the timelines, you can see the engagement stuff.
And like, you can't lie to yourself anymore, which is like the really thing that I love about it. Right.`,
